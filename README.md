EasyAuth
========

A little daemon that uses Twilio and Mailgun to intercept SMS messages and forward them to other phone numbers and email addresses. Use it to make Stanford 2Factor authentication less of a hassle!

Tech Stuff
----------
- Ruby with Sinatra
- Twilio API (10/10, would API again)

TODO
----

- Integrate Google Authenticator or similar. This would shave a second or two off the code generation time.
